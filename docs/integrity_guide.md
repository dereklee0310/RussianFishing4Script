## A Guide to Add Missing Images of Your Language
It's difficult to implement and test features for different languages all by myself.  
Therefore, this script will only provide official support for the English version from now on.  
If you want to use the other languages (e.g., ru, zh-TW, zh-CN), you should follow this guide
to take screenshots from your games and save them in the right places for it to works.

## Integrity Check
The script will check if there is any missing files at startup.  
If you see this, it means you have missing files in the `static/"your language"` directory.  
Please use `static/en` as a template, take screenshots with `Win + Shift + S` and save them until the check passes.
